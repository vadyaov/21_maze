  Together with the QPaintDevice and QPaintEngine classes, QPainter form the basis
  for Qt's paint system.

  QPainter is the class used to perform drawing operations.
  QPaintDevice represents a device that can be painted on using a QPainter.
  QPaintEngine provides the interface that the painter uses to draw onto different types of devices.



1) QPainter: used to perform drawing operations.

  * It can draw everything from simple lines to complex shapes like pies and chords.

  * It can also draw aligned text and pixmaps.

  * Normally, it draws in a "natural" coordinate system, but it can also do view
    and world transformation.

  * QPainter can operate on any object that inherits the QPaintDevice class!

  * The common use of QPainter is inside a widget's paint event:
      - Construct and customize (e.g. set the pen or the brush) the painter.
      - Then draw.
      - Remember to destroy the QPainter object after drawing.


2) QPaintDevice: abstraction of a two-dimensional space that can be painted on using a QPainter

  * Its default coordinate system has its origin located at the top-left position.

  * X increases to the right and Y increases downwards. The unit is one pixel.


3) QPaintEngine: provides an abstract definition of how QPainter draws to a given device
   on a given platform.

   * QPaintEngine is created and owned by the QPaintDevice that created it
